# What is this package?

Firebase is a great tool for creating production-ready apps quickly, and it comes with a lot of built-in flexibility. However, for most use-cases, the full range of flexibility that Firebase offers means rather tedious boilerplate code.

This package is intended to reduce boilerplate, while still accommodating for 99% of Firebase use-cases.
